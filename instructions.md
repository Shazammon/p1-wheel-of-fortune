# Game Play Instructions

On a player's turn, do the following: 
1. Spin the wheel of fortune - Spin the wheel by pressing the "Spin" button. 
2. Guess a letter - The player can guess a letter that they believe will be found in the puzzle. Do this by entering a letter in the input box and pressing "Guess." 
- If the letter is not found in the puzzle, the turn immediately moves to the next player. 
- If one of more of the guessed letters is found in the puzzle, the player can spin again or choose to solve the puzzle. To solve the puzzle, press "I'd like to solve the puzzle!" 

If the player incorrectly solve the puzzle, the turn moves to the next player. If the player correctly solves the puzzle, they they have won the round. Their cash balance is doubled and added to their cumulative score. (Free plays do not carry over to the next round.)

To play another round, simply select "Start New Round."

The "Reset Scores" button will start a new game and reset all current and cumulative cash balances to $0. 

Spins:
- If the spin lands on "Lose a turn", the turn moves to the next player.
- If a spin lands on "Bankrupt", the player cash balance goes to $0 and the turn moves to the next player. 
- If a spin lands on "Free Play", the player will be awarded a free play for each instance of the guessed letter found in the puzzle. Free plays will automatically be used to avoid a "Bankrupt" or "Lose a Turn" spin.
